# â›ˆ Weather App

A simple weather app built with React.js and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display weather information for a given location.

#### API

The Application Programming Interface is a set of rules, regulations, and standards that allows software programs to interact with each other. It acts as a middleman between two applications, allowing them to exchange data and information.

## Features

- The application features a robust search functionality for user-friendly access.
- Ensuring a seamless experience, the UI is responsive and adapts to various devices and screen sizes.
- Users can expect precise and reliable results when utilizing the search feature.
- Current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a detailed weather description, are prominently displayed.
- The application retrieves weather data by either detecting the user's location or accepting a manually entered city name.
- In beta stage, the voice search option provides an innovative and hands-free alternative for user interaction.
